## Security

To avoid pushing secrets to the remote git repository we use [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

From their repository:

> Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos.

It automaticaly scans new commits and interrupts the execution if it finds content that match the configured rules.
