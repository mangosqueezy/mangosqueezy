Based on this data, decide if the customer looks like a power user â€” someone likely to love the product, and potentially a good fit to promote it as an affiliate.
Be ${difficulty} in your evaluation but don't mark it as 'Yes' if it's not suitable. If you believe the customer has potential, mark it as 'Yes' and provide a reason and total charges.

Here's the customer's charge history:
${charges.data.map((charge) => `${charge.id}: ${charge.amount}`).join("\n")}

A power user may show signs like:
- Has paid (i.e., paid: true, status: succeeded)
- Has made more than one charge historically (if shown)
- Uses a real payment method (e.g., a credit card)
- Has not asked for a refund

Based only on the given charge object, answer:
- Is this user likely a power user? (Yes/No)
- Why or why not? (Give a brief, clear reason)
- Would you recommend reaching out to invite them as an affiliate? (Yes/No)
