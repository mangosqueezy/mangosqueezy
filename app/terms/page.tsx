          Terms and Conditions

        <div className="text-component line-height-lg v-space-md">
          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern
            your relationship with Tapasom application (the "Service") operated
            by Tapasom Inc ("us", "we", or "our").
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our
            Tapasom application (the "Service").
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your
            acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to
            all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
            Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not
            access the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
            ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
            and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a
            monthly basis.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
            cancel it or Tapasom Inc cancels it. You may cancel your
            Subscription renewal either through your online account management
            page or by contacting Tapasom Inc customer support team.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
            process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Stripe
            with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
            address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment
            method information. By submitting such payment information, you
            automatically authorize Tapasom Inc to charge all Subscription fees
            incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Tapasom Inc
            will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
            manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
            corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
          </p>

          <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Tapasom Inc, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
            Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
            will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Tapasom Inc will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
            change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
            your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
            comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
            Subscription fee amount.
          </p>

          <h2>Refunds</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
            Stripe on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of
            Tapasom Inc.
          </p>
